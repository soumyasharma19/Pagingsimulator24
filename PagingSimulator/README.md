# Page-Replacement-Simulator
This project is a simulator we built to dig into how page replacement algorithms work in operating systems. It focuses on three big ones: FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal. Furthur Clock algorithm was added to learn more algorithms. The idea is to see how these handle memory frames and page requests, tracking stuff like page faults and showing the results in charts. It’s a hands-on way to compare their efficiency.
# What It Does
Runs simulations for FIFO, LRU, Clock and Optimal algorithms.
Lets you set the number of memory frames and type in your own page request sequence.
Shows page faults for each algorithm so you can compare them.
Draws charts to visualize how they perform.
Has a simple GUI to make it easy to use and **CyberPunk 2077** theme for better interface.
# Getting Started
## What You Need
Python 3.x installed (any recent version should work).  
Libraries: tkinter (comes with Python) and matplotlib (you might need to install this).
## Setup Steps
###  Grab the code from the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mynkpandey/Page-Replacement-Simulator.git
```
### Move into the project folder:
```bash
cd Page-Replacement-Simulator
```
### Install matplotlib if you don’t have it:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
## How to Run It
### Start the simulator with:
```bash
python main.py
```
### In the GUI:
Pick how many memory frames you want.  
Enter a page sequence (like 1,2,3,4,1).  
Choose which algorithms to test (FIFO, LRU, Optimal or Clock).  
Hit Run Simulation to see what happens.  
Check out the page faults and the comparison chart it spits out.
# Tools I Used
Python: For all the main code and logic.  
Tkinter: Built the GUI with this.  
Matplotlib: Makes the charts to see the results.  
# Project Breakdown
main.py: Kicks everything off.  
simulation.py: Where the algorithm logic lives.  
gui.py: Handles the interface and user inputs.  
visualization.py: Turns the data into charts.
